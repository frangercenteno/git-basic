## Know status

- If exist files with red color, it means that they have not been added to change control (___Working Directory___) or your are not having a control.

```bash

```
---

## Add filles and prepare it to the ___staging___ 

- When typing the command `$ git add ` and add a __*"."*__ to finish, all change will be added, but if you want to add a specific file, just type its name.

- All files in a directory can be added with the next command.

```bash
	$ git add src/
	$ git add src/*.js
	$ git add */*.js
	$ git add .
```

---

## Add files to ___staging___  (commit)

```bash
	$ git commit -m "commit message"
```
- The command "m" representing to command to write a message.

---
## See differences in changes made to files before ___staging__

## Help command
